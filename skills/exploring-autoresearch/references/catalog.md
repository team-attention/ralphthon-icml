# Autoresearch Example Catalog

Use this catalog for read-only discovery. Select 3-7 entries and verify mutable facts before recommending them. Popularity is a dated discovery signal, never a quality proof; this catalog intentionally avoids hard-coded star counts. Any popularity comparison must carry a `2026-07-12` snapshot date or a newer verified date.

## Authoritative implementation guidance

### [VESSL Cloud autoresearch guide](https://docs.cloud.vessl.ai/examples/autoresearch)

- **Official/community status:** Official VESSL documentation.
- **Resource type:** Current workflow guide.
- **Why it is relevant:** Explains VESSL's supported autoresearch workflow and cloud-job model.
- **Compute/platform assumptions:** VESSL Cloud GPU jobs; published examples may use H100 hardware.
- **Cost/credential exposure:** VESSL authentication, storage, and billable GPU exposure; verify live pricing before creation.
- **Benchmark compatibility:** Related to the Karpathy-style `val_bpb` workflow, but published H100 timings, costs, cache sizes, and `val_bpb` are not A100 evidence.
- **Mutable/pinned status:** Live documentation is mutable; record an access date and pin executable sources separately.
- **License caveat:** Documentation terms do not automatically license linked code or datasets; verify each source.
- **Safety caveat:** Do not provision compute or inherit job/cleanup defaults during discovery.

### [VESSL Cloud Cookbook autoresearch recipe](https://github.com/vessl-ai/vessl-cloud-cookbook/tree/main/autoresearch)

- **Official/community status:** Official VESSL repository.
- **Resource type:** Executable recipe.
- **Why it is relevant:** Provides concrete job, volume, and autoresearch orchestration files used by this repository's execution path.
- **Compute/platform assumptions:** VESSL Cloud and GPU-backed batch jobs; upstream defaults may target H100.
- **Cost/credential exposure:** Requires cloud authentication and may create billable compute and persistent storage.
- **Benchmark compatibility:** Closely matches Karpathy `train.py` optimization at known revisions; compare exact files and pins before claiming compatibility.
- **Mutable/pinned status:** The mutable `main` cookbook should be pinned before reproduction.
- **License caveat:** Verify the repository license and the licenses of benchmark data and dependencies at the chosen revision.
- **Safety caveat:** Do not inherit unbounded loops, fan-out, destructive rollback, or timeout behavior; use `auto-research` for the bounded execution overlay.
