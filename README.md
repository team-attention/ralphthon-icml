# ralphthon-icml

Codex plugin and skill repository for `Ralphthon @ICML "Auto Research" supported by Codex`.

The plugin exposes five research workflows as discoverable Agent Skills.

## Included

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `exploring-autoresearch` | Discover and compare directly linked autoresearch examples, cookbooks, and implementations without executing them. |
| `auto-research` | Build general Track 1 research, run the pinned official VESSL autoresearch recipe on A100 with local-first W&B tracking, or package a no-compute Track 2 Review Agent and result. |
| `wandb-onboarding` | Guide W&B Cloud signup, private API-key login, and an offline-first synthetic run. |
| `vessl-cloud-onboarding` | Verify current VESSL Cloud and `vesslctl` setup before optional billable compute. |
| `world-model-ideation` | Convert a world-model concept into a falsifiable experiment and Track path. |

Each skill may include `references/` for detailed official guidance, `assets/` for reusable templates, and `agents/openai.yaml` for Codex UI metadata.

## Install

Install this repository as a local Codex plugin from its parent marketplace or plugin source path. The plugin ID is:

```text
ralphthon-icml
```

Codex discovers skills from `skills/`. Workflow behavior, verification, and output contracts live in each `SKILL.md`.

## Usage

Ask naturally or name a skill:

```text
Use exploring-autoresearch to compare autoresearch starting points for an Apple silicon laptop.
Use auto-research to freeze a research spec for Track 1 and Track 2.
Use wandb-onboarding to verify a synthetic W&B run offline before upload.
Use vessl-cloud-onboarding to check VESSL Cloud pricing without creating compute.
Use world-model-ideation to compare three falsifiable world-model questions.
```

W&B and VESSL Cloud use a hybrid browser-and-terminal workflow. Codex can open official pages, inspect visible state, and run safe diagnostics. The user handles credentials, OAuth, MFA, CAPTCHA, email verification, legal acceptance, API keys, payment details, and final signup submission.

`exploring-autoresearch` discovers and compares read-only examples; `auto-research` executes or produces submissions under this repository's evidence and safety gates. Discovery never authorizes cloning, credentials, compute, or external loop and rollback commands.

## Autoresearch Example Overview

The discovery skill provides a concise direct-link overview and a fuller classified catalog. Good first anchors are [Karpathy's minimal autoresearch reference](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch), the [official VESSL executable recipe](https://github.com/vessl-ai/vessl-cloud-cookbook/tree/main/autoresearch), and [W&B ARIA's Preview workflow](https://docs.wandb.ai/aria/autoresearch). It also compares observability, Apple MLX, coding-agent, Kubernetes/PR, and community-index examples while labeling compute, credentials, benchmark compatibility, mutability, licensing, and safety caveats.

## Auto Research Paths

`auto-research` starts by choosing exactly one mutually exclusive path:

- **Training path:** use [`vessl-ai/vessl-cloud-cookbook/autoresearch`](https://github.com/vessl-ai/vessl-cloud-cookbook/tree/main/autoresearch) pinned at [`97a0af14b0acae042162b1f70f17fbe2d570afa2`](https://github.com/vessl-ai/vessl-cloud-cookbook/tree/97a0af14b0acae042162b1f70f17fbe2d570afa2/autoresearch) as the execution source of truth, run it on an explicitly approved live single-A100 spec, then use verified evidence for a Track 1 paper. At that pin, its baseline `prepare.py` and `train.py` match [`karpathy/autoresearch@228791f`](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch/commit/228791fb499afffb54b46200aca536f79142f117). This path requires W&B and VESSL Cloud onboarding.
- **General Track 1 path:** use a non-Karpathy workflow or credible existing evidence to produce the research agent workflow, paper, and self-review. It **does not automatically require W&B, VESSL, or A100**.
- **Track 2-only:** freeze a reusable **Track 2 Review Agent** as `review-agent.md`, then use it to review an existing Track 1 paper without provisioning compute, cloning the training repository, or claiming a new experiment. Submit both the agent artifact and review result.

The Training path does not define a custom model or benchmark preset. Its **unchanged benchmark** keeps the official recipe's preparation, dependencies, and baseline intact. After the baseline, each candidate may modify only `train.py`, with one hypothesis and one change. The safety overlay permits one baseline, at most three **sequential** candidates, and one unchanged confirmation rerun. It does not import the cookbook's parallel fan-out, unbounded loop, H100 default, or destructive reset guidance. Only a lower `val_bpb` that repeats in the same A100/cache/evaluation environment may support a Track 1 claim; A100 and published H100 measurements are not directly comparable.

The official cookbook remains the only remote compute plane: a participant-owned fork/branch is pushed, `vesslctl job create` clones it, an object volume supplies the benchmark cache, and `vesslctl job show`/`job logs` return state and results. The branch, volume, Job, and polling-timeout behavior are reviewed before spend. A polling timeout does not stop remote billing, so the approved cleanup flow must inspect and, when authorized, terminate the Job.

Experiment metadata is written after each fetched VESSL log to the local append-only recorder `skills/auto-research/scripts/record_experiment.py`; W&B offline is mandatory. W&B receives only approved run/trial, Git/cookbook, VESSL Job/A100/cache correlation, metric, resource, time, and status fields, grouped by campaign with `job_type=autoresearch-trial`. Console output, code, Git patches, requirements, machine metrics/info, datasets, checkpoints, artifacts, credentials, and API keys are disabled or excluded. W&B's offline format still contains internal SDK metadata such as a sanitized host label, SDK/Python/platform versions, timestamps/runtime, and SDK telemetry records. Before any `wandb sync`, disclose those fields and show the entity, project, visibility, allowlist, and exact offline run directories, then obtain explicit confirmation.

Before VESSL creates anything billable, query `vesslctl resource-spec list --usable-only` and show a live cost card with the exact resource spec, hourly price, credits, image, expected wall time, storage exposure, and cleanup choice. The created Job configuration must retain that confirmed **single A100** spec; stop rather than silently falling back to another GPU or enlarging the model. If VESSL exposes runtime GPU identity independently, cross-check it without changing the benchmark.

Manual live-account boundary: repository tests do not create accounts, submit OAuth/MFA/CAPTCHA, enter an API key, sync a W&B run, authenticate VESSL, or create/stop paid compute. Those steps remain user-controlled and require their documented action-time confirmations.

Test the full safety gate with this prompt:

```text
Use auto-research in Training path with the pinned official VESSL cookbook. Verify W&B offline first, show the approved sync fields, inspect the current VESSL single-A100 live cost and object-volume exposure, and stop for confirmation before creating compute.
```

## Official Platform Material

VESSL's current repository collection includes the main [VESSL Cloud cookbook](https://github.com/vessl-ai/vessl-cloud-cookbook), [Gemma 4 fine-tuning](https://github.com/vessl-ai/vessl-cloud-cookbook/tree/main/gemma4-finetuning), [GPU cost benchmark](https://github.com/vessl-ai/vessl-cloud-cookbook/tree/main/gpu-cost-benchmark), [AQR finance](https://github.com/vessl-ai/vessl-cloud-cookbook/tree/main/aqr-finance), and the [recipe template](https://github.com/vessl-ai/vessl-cloud-cookbook/tree/main/_template). See the skill's [curated current/legacy map](skills/vessl-cloud-onboarding/references/official-repositories.md). Older `vessl-ai/examples` and `vessl-training-recipes` repositories are reference-only, not the current Cloud execution source.

W&B does not maintain one repository literally named “cookbook.” Its official equivalents are the [documentation source](https://github.com/wandb/docs), [agent skills](https://github.com/wandb/skills), [examples](https://github.com/wandb/examples), [education](https://github.com/wandb/edu), [Artifacts examples](https://github.com/wandb/artifacts-examples), [Launch Jobs](https://github.com/wandb/launch-jobs), and [Sweeps](https://github.com/wandb/sweeps). The optional [ARIA autoresearch](https://docs.wandb.ai/aria/autoresearch) surface may analyze an approved synced run, but VESSL remains the scheduler. See the [W&B ecosystem map](skills/wandb-onboarding/references/official-ecosystem.md) for what this plugin uses and deliberately excludes.
