# ralphthon-icml

Codex plugin and skills repository for `Ralphthon @ICML "Auto Research" supported by Codex`.

This repo packages a small, event-specific Codex surface in the same style as the local Vercel plugin package: plugin manifest, discoverable `SKILL.md` files, slash commands, and lightweight validation.

## Included

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` plugin manifest for Codex discovery.
- `skills/hello-ralphthon-icml/SKILL.md` for attendee welcome, QR/POP copy, and event orientation.
- `commands/hello-ralphthon-icml.md` slash command guide for producing a welcome pack.
- `scripts/validate_plugin.py` stdlib validation for required files and frontmatter fields.

## Install

Install this repository as a local Codex plugin from its parent marketplace or plugin source path. The plugin id is:

```text
ralphthon-icml
```

Codex discovers skills from:

```text
skills/
```

## Usage

Ask naturally:

```text
Create a Ralphthon @ICML attendee welcome pack.
Draft QR and POP copy for Ralphthon @ICML.
Brief me on event orientation for guests arriving at NAVER D2SF 강남.
```

Or invoke the command directly:

```text
/hello-ralphthon-icml
```

The command guides the agent through preflight, planning, verification, and a compact output format. When network access is available, the agent should verify the live Luma page before finalizing attendee-visible details.
